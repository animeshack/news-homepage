## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

Css grid is actually great for layouts and landing of a page, didn't realised that until now. The code for creating a complex layout in Flexbox is more complex, dispersed and time-consuming, while that created with the Grid is much faster, tidier and simpler. Flexbox is great too but Css Grid feels easier to use in my own aspect.

### Continued development

I'm getting quite familiar with the use of media query, would like to try Mobile-first workflow in my upcoming projects.
